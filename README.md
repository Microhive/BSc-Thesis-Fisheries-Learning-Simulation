# Bsc Thesis Fisheries Learning Simulation
This project is some of the work I produced during my bachelor computer science thesis at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya. I have uploaded the software in hope that if someone is interested in this type of research, they can look up how I approached the problems and learn from them. It contains the software, UML, and associated resources that I used to design the simulation processes. 

I take no responsibility in any harm that may happen to your machine if you run the software.

# Project Description
The aim of the study was to develop a proposal and software specification and prototype, for a classroom learning software in the form of a game. For the purposes of this study, the case was a learning software for  the  Faroese fisheries, with focus on the  tragedy  of  the commons in fisheries, which is the concept of fisheries exploiting fish stocks by overfishing.
