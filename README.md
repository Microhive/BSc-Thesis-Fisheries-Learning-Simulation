# Bsc Thesis Fisheries Learning Simulation
This project is some of the work I produced during my bachelor computer science thesis at Fróðskaparsetur Føroya. I have uploaded the software in hope that if someone is interested in this type of research, they can look up how I approached the problems and learn from them. It contains the software, UML, and associated resources that I used to design the simulation processes. 

Having said that, if there is anything you should get out of this work it is the Machinations software. It is a very useful tool for helping you develop and understand game mechanics - not just for games, but simulations of resource allocations which applies well to logistics, businesses, and ecologies simulations.

* Unity3D (Game Engine)

# Project Description
The aim of the study was to develop a proposal and software specification and prototype, for a classroom learning software in the form of a game. For the purposes of this study, the case was a learning software for  the  Faroese fisheries, with focus on the  tragedy  of  the commons in fisheries, which is the concept of fisheries exploiting fish stocks by overfishing.

Based on realistic fish stocks and economic models, students can learn industry activities, by engaging virtually as actors in the fisheries industry simulation. The mode ls are based on several interviews with domain experts, i.e. teachers, biologists, and economists. The value of the software is that students are encouraged to discuss the simulation and the results.

The software is not maintained and I take no responsibility in any potential harm caused by this software.
